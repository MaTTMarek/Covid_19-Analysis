1.Data Source and Collection 
Found this date set on the Kaggle website. The document was produced by The University of Oxford and 
‘Our World in Data’. It is updated daily.

2. Data Content 
The dataset uses the most recent official numbers from governments and health ministries worldwide. 
Population estimates for per-capita metrics are based on the United Nations World Population Prospects. 
Income groups are based on the World Bank classification. 

3. Reason for collection 
For a long time, I couldn't decide what to choose. I chose it because I wanted to see for myself what the 
numbers could tell me about this pandemic, because you often heard a lot of fake news, and sometimes it 
was hard to distinguish truth from false.

4. Analysis conducted using Python:

    Exploratory visual analysis
    Geospatial analysis
    Regression analysis
    Cluster analysis
    Time-series analysis
